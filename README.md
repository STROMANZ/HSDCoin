# HSDCoin
CSE Module 4: HSDCoin an Ethereum based Smart Contract

Using this code:

## install the chrome metamask extention (wallet)
https://metamask.io/
Install save and enter secret words.
MetaMask will contain your private and public key.
Currency will be stored in the blockchain, not your wallet!

## add ropsten test ethereum to metamask from a faucet
https://faucet.metamask.io/

## to understand Ether and other units, see:

Terms like Wei, Babbage, Shannon, Szabo, Finney will make sense.
